ODR D task
0.	Table of significant neurons (for each monkey, time point, aligned to developmental marker)
•	Also break down by area (posterior vs. anterior PFC)
•	ACC
1.	PSTH aligned to the 2-plate closure timepoint
•	ODR
•	ODRD
•	Antisaccade
    A.	All neurons
    B.	All significant Neurons
    C.	Significant C, D neurons

2.	Comparison of delay period activity in time
3.	Fano factor
4.	Spike-count correlation (for pairs of neurons) 
5.	Discriminability between stimuli
•	ROC analysis
•	Tuning width
•	Decoding analysis - using entire population
6.	dPCA
7.	PCA - dimensionality reduction
8.	Behavior analysis
•	Training trajectory of each monkey
•	Precision in ODR
•	Accuracy in ODR
•	Different Error codes
•	Error rate as a function of distractor distance from cue
•	Reaction Time
•	Serial bias (we expect higher NMDA expression in older animals -> stronger serial bias)
9.	Firing rate as a function of performance
•	Match young, older sessions for performance - plot firing rate
•	Firing rate as a function of performance
•	Intercepts of firing rate as function of performance differ for ODR and ODRD tasks
•	Firing rate in correct vs. error trials
•	Tuning bias

10.	Alternative theories of working memory
•	LFPs
•	γ-bursting rate
•	"silent" decoding
11.	Cross-correlation: strength of connections between neurons



ANTISACCADE TASK
1.	Behavior as a function of time from maturation milestone
•	Performance in three variants of the task
•	Trial outcomes in each task variant
•	Reaction time
•	Tachometric curve
2. Cue and Saccade related firing rate as a function of time
•	Identify V, M, VM neurons
•	Ipsilateral vs. Contralateral Responses
3. Relationship of firing rate with performance:
•	Splitting High - Low performance sessions
•	Correct and Error Trials: split between cue and saccade responses
•	Choice Probability
4. Vector inversion
•	Related: Time-resolved ROC analysis
5. Mixed selectivity for Cue location in ODR vs. Antisaccade task
6. Relationship between ODR delay period and antisaccade baseline
